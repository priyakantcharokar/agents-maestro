I'm Priyakant Charokar. I bring over 21 years of experience in IT, currently serving as a Lead Architect. My expertise spans enterprise architecture, cloud strategy, and data platforms. I’ve been deeply involved in Data, AI, and ML projects—focusing on building intelligent systems and enabling data-driven decision-making. More recently, I’ve been exploring Generative AI and Agentic AI use cases, especially in finance and HR.

I’m passionate about learning and constantly upskilling—earning certifications across cloud, data, and AI technologies. This learning mindset also led me to pursue the Senior Management Program at IIM Calcutta (SMP – 2025), where I’m sharpening my strategic and leadership abilities.

I currently lead a team supporting 90+ developers across 4 verticals and mentor 14+ architects and senior engineers. I’ve led large-scale modernization efforts, implemented FinOps practices, and migrated legacy systems to scalable microservices on AWS, GCP, and Azure.

My project experience includes leading digital transformation at global firms like SBI, Nordea, HSBC, and working as an architect with the Cathay Pacific Innovation Centre, driving forward-thinking technology solutions.

I love aligning technology with business impact—solving complex problems, mentoring teams, and delivering secure, scalable systems that create real enterprise value.
