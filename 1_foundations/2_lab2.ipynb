Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources.

       "Creating a new ethical framework for AI that balances innovation with societal well-being is both a crucial and complex task. Here are key principles to consider, along with suggestions for addressing potential conflicts:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Principles\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Beneficence**: AI should be developed and deployed with the intent to promote well-being and benefit humanity. This principle emphasizes that AI should primarily serve to improve individuals' lives and societal conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Non-Maleficence**: AI systems should be designed to minimize harm. This includes preventing misuse, ensuring safety, and avoiding harmful consequences from autonomous decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Justice**: AI must promote fairness and equitable access. Systems should be designed to avoid biases and discrimination, ensuring benefits of AI are widely distributed and do not exacerbate inequalities.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Transparency**: Itâ€™s crucial that AI systems are understandable and explicable to users and stakeholders. This includes clear communication about how choices are made and what data is used.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Accountability**: There should be mechanisms to hold developers and users accountable for the outcomes of AI systems. This includes having clear chains of responsibility and protocols for addressing ethical violations.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Privacy**: Respect for individual privacy and data protection must be paramount in AI development and use. Users should have control over their personal information, and data collection should be minimized and justified.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Sustainability**: AI development should consider long-term impacts on the environment and society, promoting practices that are environmentally sustainable and socially responsible.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Collaboration**: Stakeholder engagement is essential. Developers, users, ethicists, policymakers, and affected communities should collaborate throughout the AI lifecycle to ensure diverse perspectives are included.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Addressing Conflicts\n",
       "\n",
       "Conflicts between these principles are likely to arise, so a structured approach for addressing these is necessary:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Prioritization Framework**: Develop guidelines on how to prioritize principles in various contexts. For example, in a healthcare application, beneficence may take precedence over transparency if immediate benefits to patient health are at stake.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Stakeholder Consultation**: Regular dialogues and consultations with a diverse set of stakeholders can illuminate conflicts and potential resolutions. This ensures that solutions are contextually relevant and values-consistent.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Iterative Assessment**: Implement an ongoing assessment and review mechanism for AI systems. This allows for adaptation and revision in response to real-world impacts, thus harmonizing conflicting principles over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Ethical Review Boards**: Establish interdisciplinary ethical review boards that include technologists, ethicists, legal experts, and community representatives. These boards can assess potential conflicts and monitor projects for adherence to ethical guidelines before deployment.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Public Engagement and Education**: Foster public understanding of AI and its ethical implications to cultivate an informed society that can engage in discussions and hold developers accountable.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Clear Regulations and Standards**: Implementation of clear laws and standards that provide a framework for compliance with ethical principles and address conflicts when principles clash, ensuring that there are external checks and balances.\n",
       "\n",
       "By embedding these principles into the AI development process and creating structures for conflict resolution, we can foster innovation that aligns with societal well-being, ultimately leading to AI systems that are ethical, safe, and beneficial for all."

       "\n",
       "**Key Principles:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Respect for Human Rights and Dignity**: AI systems should be designed and deployed in ways that respect and promote human rights, dignity, and autonomy.\n",
       "2. **Transparency and Explainability**: AI systems should be transparent, explainable, and accountable, enabling users to understand how decisions are made and what data is used.\n",
       "3. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: AI systems should be designed to prevent bias, ensure fairness, and promote equal opportunities for all individuals and groups.\n",
       "4. **Safety and Security**: AI systems should be designed and deployed with robust safety and security measures to prevent harm to individuals and society.\n",
       "5. **Accountability and Responsibility**: Developers, deployers, and users of AI systems should be held accountable for their actions and decisions, and be responsible for mitigating potential risks and harms.\n",
       "6. **Inclusivity and Accessibility**: AI systems should be designed to be accessible and usable by diverse populations, including those with disabilities.\n",
       "7. **Environmental Sustainability**: AI systems should be designed and deployed in ways that minimize their environmental impact and promote sustainable development.\n",
       "8. **Continuous Learning and Improvement**: AI systems should be designed to learn from experience, adapt to changing contexts, and improve over time, while maintaining their alignment with these principles.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Addressing Potential Conflicts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Trade-offs between principles**: When conflicts arise, prioritize the principles based on context and severity of potential harm. For example, in a life-critical AI system, safety and security might take precedence over transparency and explainability.\n",
       "2. **Stakeholder engagement**: Engage with diverse stakeholders, including developers, users, policymakers, and civil society, to ensure that all perspectives are considered and conflicts are addressed through collaborative decision-making.\n",
       "3. **Value-based decision-making**: Develop decision-making frameworks that incorporate human values, such as respect for human rights, fairness, and dignity, to guide trade-offs between principles.\n",
       "4. **Regulatory frameworks**: Establish regulatory frameworks that provide guidance on AI development and deployment, while allowing for flexibility and innovation.\n",
       "5. **Education and awareness**: Promote education and awareness about AI ethics among developers, users, and the general public to ensure that everyone understands the importance of these principles and their role in upholding them.\n",
       "6. **Independent review and audit**: Establish independent review and audit mechanisms to ensure that AI systems are aligned with these principles and to identify areas for improvement.\n",
       "7. **Continuous monitoring and evaluation**: Regularly monitor and evaluate AI systems to ensure that they remain aligned with these principles and to address any emerging conflicts or issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Implementation Strategies:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Establish AI ethics boards**: Set up AI ethics boards or committees to provide guidance and oversight on AI development and deployment.\n",
       "2. **Develop AI ethics guidelines**: Create guidelines and standards for AI development and deployment, incorporating these principles.\n",
       "3. **Provide education and training**: Offer education and training programs for developers, users, and policymakers on AI ethics and these principles.\n",
       "4. **Encourage transparency and accountability**: Promote transparency and accountability in AI development and deployment, through mechanisms such as auditing and reporting.\n",
       "5. **Foster international cooperation**: Collaborate with international organizations, governments, and civil society to develop and implement these principles globally.\n",
